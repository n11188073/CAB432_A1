### Core - First data persistence service

- **AWS service name:**  [eg. S3]
- **What data is being stored?:** [eg video files]
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:** [eg. large files are best suited to blob storage due to size restrictions on other services]
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:**
- **Bucket/instance/table name:**
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Core - Second data persistence service

- **AWS service name:**  [eg. DynamoDB]
- **What data is being stored?:** 
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:**
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:**
- **Bucket/instance/table name:**
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Third data service

- **AWS service name:**  [eg. RDS]
- **What data is being stored?:** [eg video metadata]
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:** [eg. ]
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:** [eg. Advanced video search requires complex querries which are not available on S3 and inefficient on DynamoDB]
- **Bucket/instance/table name:**
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### S3 Pre-signed URLs

- **S3 Bucket names:**
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### In-memory cache

- **ElastiCache instance name:**
- **What data is being cached?:** [eg. Thumbnails from YouTube videos obatined from external API]
- **Why is this data likely to be accessed frequently?:** [ eg. Thumbnails from popular YouTube videos are likely to be shown to multiple users ]
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Core - Statelessness

- **What data is stored within your application that is not stored in cloud data services?:** [eg. intermediate video files that have been transcoded but not stabilised]
- **Why is this data not considered persistent state?:** [eg. intermediate files can be recreated from source if they are lost]
- **How does your application ensure data consistency if the app suddenly stops?:** [eg. journal used to record data transactions before they are done.  A separate task scans the journal and corrects problems on startup and once every 5 minutes afterwards. ]
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Graceful handling of persistent connections

- **Type of persistent connection and use:** [eg. server-side-events for progress reporting]
- **Method for handling lost connections:** [eg. client responds to lost connection by reconnecting and indicating loss of connection to user until connection is re-established ]
- **Relevant files:**
    -


### Core - Authentication with Cognito

- **User pool name:**
- **How are authentication tokens handled by the client?:** [eg. Response to login request sets a cookie containing the token.]
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Cognito multi-factor authentication

- **What factors are used for authentication:** [eg. password, SMS code]
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Cognito federated identities

- **Identity providers used:**
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Cognito groups

- **How are groups used to set permissions?:** [eg. 'admin' users can delete and ban other users]
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Core - DNS with Route53

- **Subdomain**:  [eg. myawesomeapp.cab432.com]
- **Video timestamp:**

### Parameter store

- **Parameter names:** [eg. n1234567/base_url]

    -
